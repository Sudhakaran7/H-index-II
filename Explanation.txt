Given an array of citations, sort the array in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h 
papers have no more than h citations each."

Input Description:
First line contains, N the size of array.(1<N<1000)
Second line contains, N elements of integers in a array.

Output Description:
Print the number of papers have citations with H-index.

Sample Input:
5
0 1 3 5 6
3

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
[0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
